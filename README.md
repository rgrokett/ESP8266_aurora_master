Control Aurora Master Ocean Relax Projector via ESP8266 WiFi


The Aurora Master Ocean Relax Projector  http://goo.gl/ZmdWgr is a popular LED based night special effects light. It projects softly moving colored patterns on walls or ceiling.  But one problem it has, is that it is manually controlled. This is fine for most typical uses, but for Makers, it presents itself as a candidate for Internet of Things (IoT). Using the new ESP8266 module, with its ability to built-in WiFi,  processor and GPIO pins, it allows for easy wireless networking and interfacing, all for less than $10.

NOTE: THIS WILL VOID YOUR WARRANTY of the Aurora Master, but since itâ€™s only about $15, not a great loss if you mess up. You will be modifying the Aurora Master, removing the manual buttons and soldering a couple wires.  Using the ESP8266 makes for a low cost wireless add-on.
